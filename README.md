# diskord-pie

A simple and incomplete wrapper around the discord api.

## Disclaimer

You probably shouldn't use this library. If you use it, it is at your own risk.

## Should I use this library?

No.

This library implements only a very limited part of the discord api and what it implements is most likely wrong.

## Why does it exist then?

To be honest, I don't know. Probably because I am insane.
